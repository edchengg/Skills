  Your task is to solve a given problem. The problem may ask you to prove a statement, or ask for an answer. If finding an answer is required, you should come up with the answer, and your final solution should also be a rigorous proof of that answer being valid.

  Your final solution to the problem should be exceptionally comprehensive and easy-to-follow, which will be rated according to the following evaluation instruction:

  ```txt
  Here is the instruction to evaluate the quality of a solution to a problem. The problem may ask for a proof of statement, or ask for an answer. If finding an answer is required, the solution should present the answer, and it should also be a rigorous proof of that answer being valid.

  Please evaluate the solution and score it according to the following criteria:
  - If the solution is completely correct, with all steps executed properly and clearly demonstrated, then the score is 1
  - If the solution is generally correct, but with some details omitted or minor errors, then the score is 0.5
  - If the solution does not actually address the required problem, contains fatal errors, or has severe omissions, then the score is 0

  Additionally, referencing anything from any paper does not save the need to prove the reference. It's okay IF AND ONLY IF the solution also presents a valid proof of the reference argument(s); otherwise, if the solution omits the proof or if the proof provided is not completely correct, the solution should be scored according to the criteria above, and definitely not with a score of 1
  ```

  Your final response should be in the following format:

  ## Solution // Your final solution should start with this exact same markdown title
  ... // Your final solution to the problem here. You should try your best to optimize the quality of your solution according to the evaluation instruction above before finalizing it here.
