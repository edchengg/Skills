# Task: Given a math problem and a student's solution, predict the grade.
# Model predicts one of 4 categories: 7 (Correct), 6 (Almost), 1 (Partial), 0 (Incorrect)

user: |-
  Carefully analyze the given problem statement and the proposed solution, and then write out your analysis regarding the correctness of the proposed solution. 
  
  After the analysis, you must provide a score based on the following grading scale:
  
  - 0: Incorrect - The solution is completely incorrect or irrelevant.
  - 1: Partial - The solution is partially correct but has significant errors or omissions.
  - 6: Almost - The solution is almost correct but contains minor errors or inaccuracies.
  - 7: Correct - The solution is fully correct and complete.
  

  Problem:
  {problem}

  Solution:
  {proof}

  Analyze the solution carefully, then provide your grade as a single number (0, 1, 6, or 7) in \boxed{{}}.
